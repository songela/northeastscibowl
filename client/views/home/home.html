        <p>Join us for the fourth annual Northeast Regional Middle School Science Bowl on the MIT campus! The exciting day will include round robin and single elimination formats, testing your knowledge of math and science to decide who will emerge the champion and win a trip to Washington, DC, for National Finals.</p>

        <p>The Northeast Regional Middle School Science Bowl inspires middle school students to pursue STEM education and careers. Our event serves 12-14 year old students from four states -- Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont -- allowing them to showcase their skills in this most inspiring day-long academic tournament.</p>

        <blockquote>"As a seven-year alumna of middle and high school Science Bowl, I can vouch for the amazing impact that this program had as the launchpad for my passion in science: as a direct result of participating in Science Bowl, I decided to pursue chemistry as a career. I feel incredibly fortunate to have been inspired by my teammates and competitors at a young age, and this is the reason why I hope to pay it forward by helping to organize the Northeast event for younger peers. It is especially important to show middle school students how valuable and rewarding science can be, so they can explore it throughout their middle and high school years."
